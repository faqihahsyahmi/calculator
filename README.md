# Calculator App

## A functional sample project fully written in Python

A simple text-based Python calculator project.

This program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplicaiton `*`, and division `/`. It runs in the terminal, takes user input, processes the operation, and returns the result. 


Let's get started!

## How it works
* Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
* Performs the selected operation using basic arithmetic logic.
* Displays the result.


## Concept:
* Control strucures
* Dictionary
* Loop
* Basic Logic

## It has the following features:
* Chaining operations with previous result
* Collect number and operation from users
* The program will continue until user choose `n`
* Performs the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Simple and easy to understand code.


## Weakness/To improve:
* To have error handling for invalid inputs/operation
* To support advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root, etc)


## Versioning
* 1.0: original program with basic four operations
